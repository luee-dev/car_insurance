# car_insurance

This project's dataset was sourced from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/xiaomengsun/car-insurance-claim-data). 

It includes approximately 8,000 records of car insurance policyholders, with features such as age, income, gender, claim history, and more.

The dataset contains two target variables:

- Whether a claim has occurred.
- The total cost of the claim, given that a claim has been made.
